      "I'm an engineering leader with 9.5 years of experience in backend development, distributed systems, and cloud infrastructure. Over the years, I've worked in diverse domains — gaming, fintech, SaaS — with a strong focus on building systems that are scalable, secure, and reliable.",
      "At Zynga, I spent 5 years working on FarmVille 2 & 3, where I optimized performance, cut pre-release times from hours to minutes, and built automation frameworks that scaled to millions of players. Most recently, as Engineering Manager at Faze Technologies, I led the AWS → GCP migration, re-architected blockchain systems, and managed a team of 10+ engineers.",
      "I believe in pragmatic problem-solving, mentoring teams, and designing systems that balance performance with long-term maintainability. Outside work, I enjoy writing about tech and helping developers grow through mentorship and mock interviews."
